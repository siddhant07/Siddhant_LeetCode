#Two Pointer

# As we iterate through seats, we'll update the closest person sitting to our left, and closest person sitting to our right.

# Algorithm

# Keep track of prev, the filled seat at or to the left of i, and future, the filled seat at or to the right of i.

# Then at seat i, the closest person is min(i - prev, future - i), with one exception. i - prev should be considered infinite if there is no person to the left of seat i, and similarly future - i is infinite if there is no one to the right of seat i.

class Solution(object):
    def maxDistToClosest(self, seats):
        people = (i for i, seat in enumerate(seats) if seat)
        prev, future = None, next(people)

        ans = 0
        for i, seat in enumerate(seats):
            if seat:
                prev = i
            else:
                while future is not None and future < i:
                    future = next(people, None)

                left = float('inf') if prev is None else i - prev
                right = float('inf') if future is None else future - i
                ans = max(ans, min(left, right))

        return ans
        
# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of seats.
